#DEPECRATED: I have move to an alternative way to manage the dotfiles base of git bare repositories, therefore there is not going to be additional updates to this ones. IN case of interest move to the another repository.

# Dotfiles
This repository contains the configuration files of my machine with all the optimizations and scripts that I mainly use on a daily basis
As my first research topic, my machine has become nearly a Deep Learning workstation therefore many enviroment variables are focused on setting up libraries like CUDA or CuDNN.

Additionally, some sctipts to specific actions has been implemented:

1. **compiler**, to compile many languages and tex files
2. **extract**, to decompress most common types
3. **ide-tmux**, a personal preference to convert a terminal in a development framework with vim + tmux
4. **K2_battery**, this script is used to retrieve the level of battery of my keuchron K2
5. **screencasting**, this script has as main objetive to record the whole screen and the voice
6. **webcam**, this script uses mpv in order to display it in the rigth-bottom corner of the screen. I mainly use this last two to record my classes

It is prepared to be clone and generate the hardlinks by using stow in a Ubuntu-Mate environment
Other things that can be found
1. *vim* configuration
2. *tmux* configuration
3. *fonts*
5. *bash* configurtations

If you are interested in any of the bash scripts to record the webcam or screencasting, then head on the .scripts folder.
